# ESP32-with-DHT22-Sensor
This repository for the second task in Electronic Engineering track. Which is about design a circuit with ESP32 Microcontroller and DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. So, This circuit will read temperature and humidity data from the DHT22 sensor and display it on the Serial Monitor of the ESP32.

Task Requirements:

Design and program any electronic circuit that contains an ESP along with any sensor or electronic piece, explaining the function of the circuit.

---------------------------------
Circuit design:

1- ESP32
2- DHT22 Sensor
3- Jumper wires

Pins connections:
VCC of DHT22 to 3V3 in ESP32.

GRD of DHT22 to GRD in ESP32.

SDA of DHT22 to pin 4 in ESP32.
